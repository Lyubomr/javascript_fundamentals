// Exercises: Arrays

// EXERCISE: Your top choices

// Create an array to hold your top choices (colors, presidents, whatever).
// For each choice, log to the screen a string like: "My #1 choice is blue."
// Bonus: Change it to log "My 1st choice, "My 2nd choice", "My 3rd choice", picking the right suffix for the number based on what it is.
var myTopcars = [ "G65 AMG", "RS6 Avant", "V60 Polestar", "E63 AMG"]
for (var i = 0; i < myTopCars.length; i++) { j = i+1
  console.log("My" + " #" + j + " choice is " + myTopCars[i]);
}
